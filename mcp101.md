# MCP 101: Beginner's Guide to Model Context Protocol in VS Code (Customized for Your Setup)

Hey there! This is a refreshed, beginner-friendly ("dummy level") guide to MCP (Model Context Protocol) in VS Code, tailored exactly to *your* specific setup. I'll keep it super simple—no tech overload. We'll use your provided JSON config, which includes servers like GitHub, DeepWiki, Hugging Face, and more. This builds on your GitHub Copilot Pro subscription and fits your interests in software architecture, AI tools like Claude and Perplexity for coding efficiency, and product development tasks (like handling BOMs in PDFs)[2][3][4][5].

Think of MCP as plug-ins that let Copilot "reach out" to these servers for extra smarts, like fetching data or automating tasks. It's perfect for your Bengaluru-based workflow, where you might be designing clean architectures or optimizing AI stacks for Indian market products.

## What is MCP? (Super Simple Explanation for Your Setup)

- **The Basics**: MCP connects GitHub Copilot in VS Code to external "servers" (tools or services) via your config file. Your setup has 8 servers: github, deepwiki, huggingface, context7, sequentialthinking, memory, asana, and firecrawl. Each one adds a special power, like web scraping or task management.
- **Why Use It?**: It makes Copilot handle real-world tasks beyond just code suggestions—great for your architecture reading, AI tool evaluations, and BOM work[2][3][5]. For example, it can pull wiki info or scrape product data without leaving VS Code.
- **Key Benefit**: Ties into your Cybernetics ULTRA stack (Copilot, Perplexity, etc.) for seamless, efficient coding[4].
- **Your Config Note**: Your JSON uses HTTP for web-based servers (like github at https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/[1]) and stdio for local ones (run via npx commands). It also has inputs for things like API keys.

## How to Set It Up (Step-by-Step for Your Exact Config)

This is plug-and-play for your JSON. It takes 5-10 minutes.

1. **Open VS Code**: Ensure it's updated (Help > Check for Updates).
2. **Install Copilot**: Search "GitHub Copilot" in Extensions and install/sign in with your Pro account.
3. **Add Your Config File**: In your project folder, create `.vscode/mcp.json` and paste your exact JSON (the one with "servers" like github and firecrawl, plus "inputs" for memory_file_path and firecrawl_api_key).
4. **Handle Inputs**: When you start, VS Code will prompt for:
   - "memory_file_path": Enter a file path (e.g., "/path/to/your/memory.json") for storing notes.
   - "firecrawl_api_key": Get this from firecrawl.dev and enter it (it's hidden like a password).
5. **Install Dependencies**: For stdio servers (like context7 or firecrawl), you'll need Node.js installed. VS Code runs them automatically via npx.
6. **Enable in Copilot**: Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I on Mac) and test by typing: "List available MCP servers." It should show your 8.
7. **Gallery Mode**: All your servers have "gallery: true," so they're easy to discover in VS Code's MCP list.

**Tip**: If a server needs setup (like Asana login), Copilot will guide you. Restart VS Code if anything glitches.

## Specific Use Cases: Easy Examples for Your Servers

Here are beginner-level use cases, customized to your setup and interests (e.g., architecture design, AI efficiency, and product BOMs)[2][4][5]. Each includes why it's useful, dummy steps, and a Bengaluru twist for local relevance.

### Use Case 1: Managing GitHub Repos with "github" Server

   - **Dummy Steps**:
     1. Ensure github is in your config.
     2. In Copilot Chat: "Using github MCP, list open issues in my repo [repo-name]."
     3. Copilot lists: "Issue #1: Optimize AI stack - Assigned to you."
   - **Bengaluru Twist**: For local product dev, quickly check issues on "BOM integration for Indian suppliers."

### Use Case 2: Researching Wikis with "deepwiki" Server
   - **What It Does**: Searches deep wiki sources for structured info.
   - **Why Helpful?**: Pulls architecture resources (like clean design patterns) to enrich your reading and coding[2].
   - **Dummy Steps**:
     1. Config has it via https://mcp.deepwiki.com/sse.
     2. In Copilot Chat: "Using deepwiki MCP, find info on clean architecture principles."
     3. Copilot summarizes: "Key points: Entities, Use Cases, Boundaries..."
   - **Bengaluru Twist**: Research "Scalable architectures for Karnataka e-commerce apps."

### Use Case 3: Running ML Models with "huggingface" Server

   - **Dummy Steps**:
     1. It's set to https://hf.co/mcp.
     2. In Copilot Chat: "Using huggingface MCP, classify this text: 'AI for software design'."
     3. Copilot: "Category: Technology/Education."
   - **Bengaluru Twist**: Test models for "Sentiment analysis on Indian product reviews."

### Use Case 4: Adding Context with "context7" Server

   - **Dummy Steps**:
     1. Config has https://mcp.asana.com/sse (log in if prompted).
     2. In Copilot Chat: "Using asana MCP, create a task: Review BOM PDF."
     3. Copilot: "Task created in Asana: ID #123."
   - **Bengaluru Twist**: Manage tasks like "Update BOM for Bengaluru warehouse."

### Use Case 8: Web Scraping with "firecrawl" Server
   - **What It Does**: Scrapes websites for data.
   - **Why Helpful?**: Gathers resources for AI tool research or BOM links[3][5].
   - **Dummy Steps**:
     1. Enter firecrawl_api_key in inputs.

     3. Copilot: "Extracted: 'Tip 1: Use layers...'"
   - **Bengaluru Twist**: Scrape "Latest BOM standards from Indian gov sites."

## Tips and Warnings for Beginners with Your Setup

- **Start Small**: Test one server (like github[1]) before all eight to build confidence.
- **Security First**: Servers like firecrawl access the web—use trusted APIs and review permissions. Your config's env vars (e.g., API keys) keep things secure.
- **When It Might Not Work**: Stdio servers need Node.js; offline mode limits HTTP ones. If rate-limited, fall back to your Perplexity searches[4].
- **Troubleshooting**: Check VS Code's Output > MCP for errors. Update npx packages if needed.
- **Fits Your Stack**: This supercharges your Copilot for architecture deep-dives and efficient coding[2][3].

There you go—your custom MCP 101! Try a use case now, and it'll feel like magic for your setup. If stuck, ask Copilot directly. Happy coding!
